Calculator Use
This amortization schedule calculator allows you to create a payment table for a loan with equal loan payments for the life of a loan.

The amortization table shows how each payment is applied to the principal balance and the interest owed.

The Payment Amount is Calculated as:

Payment Amount = (Input Amount x Interest Rate)x(1 + interest rate)^n / (1 + interest rate)-1

Interest is calculated as:

Interest = Begining Balance x Interest Rate

Principal Amount is calculated as:

Principal = Payment Amount - Interest

Ending Balance or Owed Amount is calculated as

Ending Balance = Begining Balance - Principal

Say you are taking out a mortgage for $250000 at 5% interest for 360 payments, made monthly.

Enter these values into the calculator and click "Calculate" to produce an amortized schedule of monthly loan payments.

You can see that the payment amount stays the same over the course of the mortgage.

With each payment the principal owed increases and thes Interest to pay decreases
